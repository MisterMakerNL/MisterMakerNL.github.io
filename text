<p>Need some extra hands to help with your mechanical engineering projects? Or have a project that you can't do yourself? <br>
            I am available to work from home or on location. My work area is around Tilburg, Eindhoven and 's Hertogenbosch see this  <a href="/img/werkgebied.png" target="_blank">map!</a> <br>
        <br>My qualifications are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Mechanical engineering specialised in design and innovation. MBO+HBO WTB</li>
        <li>International Welding Technologist(iwt)</li><br>
        
        <p> I do a lot of CAD work, done for customers and for multiple years as an employee. 
            I recently became involved in to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD" target="_blank">FreeCAD</a> as this CAD program shows a lot of potential, 
            and does not have the Vendor lock issues that other CAD software has. It enables me to suit the software to my needs. <br>
        
            I have worked with the following CAD programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>FreeCAD</li>
                <li>Solidworks</li>
                <li>Fusion360</li>
                <li>Solid Edge</li>
                <li>Autocad</li>
                <li>Inventor</li>
                <li>Catia V5</li>
                <li>Pro/e</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p> Projects I worked on:
        <ul>
            <li>Industrial Pumps</li>
            <li>Scissor lift</li>
            <li>Office automation</li>
            <li>Furniture (also self made)</li>

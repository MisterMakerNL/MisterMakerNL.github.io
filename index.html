        <p>As creative engineer I like too thinker. Thinking on the computer designing using different CAD programs. <br>
        But I don't stop with mechanical stuff, I also work with Arduino and ESP32 using Visual studio to program these micro controllers. <br>
        <br>
        I have a lot experience with CAD programs, my current favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD" target="_blank">FreeCAD</a>, Freecad has CAM and FEM and is parametric. <br> It is only has some stability issieus that need to be adressed before going mainstream, but can easily be used for small projects. <br> I have also worked a lot with Solidworks, Solid-Edge, Fusion360, Inventor and Autocad. <br>
        I have also installed and run multiple Solidworks PDM system. <br>
        <br>
        For more organic designs which is mostly for 3D printing I use Blender 3D. I also use this awesome software for rendering and animation.

If you design something in 3D the most fun part is probably seeing it in real life, but what if you cannot make it or want to have an idea on how it looks before spending any more money on it. <br> Then 3D renders can be a good solution. <br>
I have learned to make beautifull renders in Blender, and have my workflow to convert them from Freecad or any other translation files from any other CAD program. <br>
I am also able to do kinematic and fluid simulations in Blender. <br>
Further more I made an <a href="https://mistermaker.gumroad.com/l/Linkstage_Icons" target="_blank">IconPack</a> for Freecad in Blender and this shows that you can even do a lot of 2D work in Blender. <br> The icon pack is made with a script that renders all icons on a push of a button. <br> I also made renders for bathrooms, workshops and kitchens.

             Next to doing work on my computer I am also a very practical person. I own a resin 3D printer and a FDM 3D printer and a CNC machine. <br> I use these to build all kind of fun and practical designs, almost always my own designs. <br>
             For the CNC I use Freecad and ESTLcam as CAM software. I make on the CNC from signs too coatracks too tool holders. <br>
             Further more I have an electronics desk where I can solder my own electronics together. I have used that to build multipe 3D printers and my CNC that I build myself. <br>
             I also like to do fun projects like a lightsaber and a camera rail. <br>
             On the internet I keep in touch with my fellow makers true Twitter
